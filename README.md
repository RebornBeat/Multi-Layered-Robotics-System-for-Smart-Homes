# Multi-Layered Robotics System for Smart Homes

An open-source, configurable, and modular system for integrating multiple robots, drones, and smart devices into a unified smart home ecosystem. This project enables the creation of safe, secure, and automated households, where robots not only perform various tasks but also collaborate with each other for enhanced functionality.

## Features

General System Capabilities

    Mapping & Localization: Robots autonomously map the household (both indoor and outdoor environments) and establish safe operational zones.
    GUI Dashboard: A user-friendly graphical interface displays real-time robot locations, their assigned tasks, and system health.
    Modular Design: Easily configurable to add/remove robots and customize their functionalities.

Robot Capabilities

    Household Tasks:
        Cooking robots for meal preparation.
        Cleaning robots for vacuuming, dusting, and mopping.
        Laundry robots for washing, drying, and folding clothes.

    Security:
        Surveillance Robots:
            Outdoor monitoring robots equipped with night vision and motion detection.
            Indoor monitoring robots for patrolling the interior of the house.
        Defensive Robots:
            Non-lethal options: Sound alarms, smoke, or strobe lights.
            Lethal options: Configurable based on regional laws.
        Real-time alert system integrated into the GUI for monitoring threats.

    Robot Manufacturing:
        In-house robot creation using 3D printing.
        Assembly robots for creating customized devices or tools.

    Drone Support:
        Drones for outdoor inspections, deliveries, and aerial surveillance.
        Autonomous charging and maintenance.

    Charging & Maintenance:
        Smart charging stations for all devices.
        Self-diagnosis and maintenance bots.

Collaborative Functionality

    Robots coordinate tasks to improve efficiency.
    Subgroup configurations for robots with specific roles (e.g., a kitchen team, security team).

Smart Home Integration

    Integration with existing IoT devices (smart lights, thermostats, cameras).
    Secure communication protocols for robot-to-robot and robot-to-GUI interactions.
